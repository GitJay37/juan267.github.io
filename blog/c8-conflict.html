    <p class="indent"><strong>Conversations with the Ghost in the Machine</strong> Is a blog that i started as part of my learning path in Dev Bootcamp. In it you will find articles about web development and the insights that i  gain during this weeks of deep learning. i try not to go to deep into techinical descriptios about technologies, but more about their potential and holistic use. </p>
    <h3>Conflict Resolution</h3>
    <p> I’m not a conflicting person, for most of my live I have managed to avoid creating or being involved in conflicts, and specially I’m a very hard person to get upset I think that live is to big to be concerned about small details.</p>

    <p>Most of the conflicts that I have had where with my girlfriend, and they are revolve around little things like small lies or not wanting to go out with her friends things like that.  Normally the conflicts starts when I do something bad, then she gets mad and I apologize, in other circumstances, she does something bad, I get mad, she gets mad and I apologize.</p>

    <p>In all the conflicts that I have been involved with I always try to resolve them as soon as possible either by admitting defeat or augmenting my self-out to a mutual agreement. If I think that the other person its not being rational enough as to see when he or she has been defeated I just loose interest in the conflict and walk away. </p>

    <p>Most of time my actions make conflicts better, I’m a very calm and rational being so I don’t get to much emotional about it and normally I keep my head cool.</p>

    <p>Conflicts have always been an area that I feel I’m very good at so I don’t feel the necessity to change any of my behavior regarding them. I learn from this experience that people handle conflicts in different ways, and it’s always good to distinguish the course of action of the other person so that you can help resolve the conflict in the most elegant possible way.
