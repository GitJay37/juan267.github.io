    <p class="indent"><strong>Conversations with the Ghost in the Machine</strong> Is a blog that i started as part of my learning path in Dev Bootcamp. In it you will find articles about web development and the insights that i  gain during this weeks of deep learning. i try not to go to deep into techinical descriptios about technologies, but more about their potential and holistic use. </p>
    <h3>Learning how to learn</h3>
    <p>So DBC it’s no really about coding, it’s true purpose is to teach how to learn and pick up new skills like your life depends on it. So one of the first things that I learn was that my learning style is “Concrete Random” , you may ask what the hell is a concrete random thinker , for your information I ask myself the same thing.</p>

    <p>So apparently a Concrete Ramdom thinker is basically an experimenter, is someone that its self directed and like to think new a approaches to solve problems, that’s the random part. The concrete part is that persons like me like to actually built the stuff they think, they want to touch it and see it under the sun in others words they want it to be concrete, see what I did there yeah I think you saw it.  With this in mind I now know that when DBC releases each week a new set of challenges, the best approach for me is to get hands on dirty with the problems and start experimenting with them until a solution arises.  This gives me satisfaction because I’m not wasting to much time with the theory or trying to learn from someone else, I’m just experimenting and kind of reverse-engineering the problems until I fully understand them.  This is valuable information that I didn’t have before and that will save some frustration in the future when I try to learn something different.</p>

    <p>So far down to the end of unit 1 Phase 0, I haven’t yet found a big struggle to deal with, but is good to notice that I have free time almost all week, so I have almost all my time available to DBC which makes things easier for me, but I can tell you the curriculum is hard and you need to work your way up, sometimes I think that given all the time that I have at my disposal I could dive deeper on each concept but in the end I always just finish what was mandatory for the week, that bumps me down it makes me questions if my motivation is where is supposed to be or I’m I just lazy. So I’m going to try harder during the next unit to try finish all mandatory work before Thursday and leave the rest of the week for to dive deeper and do all the bonus challenges as well.</p>

    <p>This equates perfectly into the growth vs. fix mindset.  I want to expand my growth mindset and be able to motivate myself to captivate all the amount possible of new information during this time in my life when I have time available.  This is growth thinking, wanting to improve yourself and not letting the sweet charming’s of inertia keep you on the same page that you always have been. Knowing today that if someone ask me If I could make them a simple webpage , I would be able to do it using basic HTML and CSS, is a powerful booster , it really show you to power of the work and hours that we are putting on this life project and the benefits that is generating for us, so always question yourself , what can I do know that I couldn’t two weeks before and then think but what could I do next I I try harder and improve my knowledge, I could invincible, that is growth mindset and it feels great.</p>
