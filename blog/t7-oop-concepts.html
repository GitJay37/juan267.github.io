    <p class="indent"><strong>Conversations with the Ghost in the Machine</strong> Is a blog that i started as part of my learning path in Dev Bootcamp. In it you will find articles about web development and the insights that i  gain during this weeks of deep learning. i try not to go to deep into techinical descriptios about technologies, but more about their potential and holistic use. </p>
    <h3>Let me Scope that variable for you</h3>
    <p>So ruby has 3 different kinds of variables: </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Local variables</li>
        <li>Instance variables</li>
        <li>Class variables </li>
    </ul>
    <p>They all serve a different purposed and they all should be for different occasions. The big difference between them is Scope. Lets talk about each one independently:</p>

    <p>Local Variables: this is your most basic kind of variable, and their scope its very well delimited. This kind of variable only exist inside the block in which it is defined. So for example: </p>

    <pre><code>

      X = 1

      Def some_method
        X=2
      End

      Class MyVariable
        X=3
      End

    </code></pre>


    <p>@instance variables: As you can see @instance variables start with an @ sign, this is what lets us know that we are working with an instance variable.  @Instance variables are used inside classes and their power relies in that all instances of a class will have a  unique value for each one of the @instance variables defined inside the class. This let us used @instance variables across all methods that are inside a class. </p>

    <p>At last @@class variables start with two @ signs , and they are the a little more hard to comprehend. They are more powerful and dangerous than the other variables, and because of that you will see them lest often than the others. @@class variables have the power that all instances of a class are going to share that variable , so for example when you change this variable for an instance you are also changing it for all the other instances of that class, this can be beneficial in a lot of cases but it can also be very dangerous and broke your code. The other thing about @@class variables is that they get inherit to subclasses meaning that they can affect even instance of other classes that you where no aware off.</p>
