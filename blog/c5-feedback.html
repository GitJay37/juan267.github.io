    <p class="indent"><strong>Conversations with the Ghost in the Machine</strong> Is a blog that i started as part of my learning path in Dev Bootcamp. In it you will find articles about web development and the insights that i  gain during this weeks of deep learning. i try not to go to deep into techinical descriptios about technologies, but more about their potential and holistic use. </p>
    <h3>Its all about Team Work and confidence: </h3>
    <p>Pairing it’s a big deal in DBC, so being comfortable with it it’s a most to have a successful experience with the program.  I strongly believe that working by pairs in a challenge it’s extremely beneficial when some criteria its meet, that means that in some cases bad experiences are going to arise. </p>

    <p>To have a successful pairing session is necessary that both peers feel comfortable working with each other that means that you don’t feel shy and that you have the necessary confidence to speak freely to your partner. This may be easy for extrovert persons, that immediately feel in resonance with whoever they work with, but if you throw two introvert individuals in a session that have never met before I guaranteed that some awkwardness its going to arise and that gets exponentially worse by Google hangouts, well hanging. </p>

    <p>This doesn’t mean that introverts are doom, it just means that during Phase 0 they are going to struggle a lit bit more during paring sessions, but once they get to know their peers better and start to see them not as strangers but as friends and teammates, everything changes and pairing sessions become a wonderful experience. That’s why I believe that paring during phase 1 would be a lot better that what it is in phase 0. Pairing face to face and with someone that you know well and that you have confidence with will make coding a more fun and rewarding experience. </p>

    <p>For me pairing in this moment it’s a nerve inducing experience at first but as I get to know more and more people from the cohort and how nice everyone is, I get more comfortable with it and definitely enjoy my paring session a lot more.  The most rewarding part about paring is seeing how different another person sees a problem and how they approach it, this gives you a lot of insight of how coding it’s a creative activity, and also gives you the humility to learn from others that have different perspectives and knowledge.</p>

    <p>Now regarding feedback, first lets be clear about something, I have always for my entire life suck at giving feedback to peers. For me it just doesn’t feel well unless I have a LOT of confidence with the person I giving feedback to, what I mean its that if I just have meet another person, that in this moment it’s a complete stranger to me, what entitles me to give he or she feedback on a subject that I’m not an expert?  It just doesn’t feel right, I have no moral background to make critiques to this other individual even if they are constructive as I’m also a beginner so by definition I don’t know exactly what is constructive or not. So at this moment I don’t feel comfortable giving constructive feedback. I do find feedback from instructors or peers that are more experience than me to be very helpful; this is speaking just on the technical side of things.</p>

    <p>As for giving feedback on cultural aspects, my policy is that unless my peer is clearly being rude, not cooperative or in general a really disgusting person (Nobody in DBC complies with this criteria you are all awesome), My feedback will always be positive and kind, we are all together on this journey and learning from each other, so the only thing that I can do is to encourage you to keep going and making awesome work, I wont pick on minor things I feel its not necessary and it just gets on the way. </p>

    <p>  As for the feedback that I have receive it has been 99% positive and have encourage me to work harder on the program and keep pushing my learning.</p>

    <p>To conclude I really believe in the power of working in pairs, but I also thing that for it to really reach its full potential it takes a time to know your peers and really feel comfortable working with them, I don’t expect that the first paring session with someone new to be a blast but I do expect that my third or forth session with the same person session will be amazing.</p>
