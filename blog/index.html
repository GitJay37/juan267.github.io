    <p class="indent"><strong>Conversations with the Ghost in the Machine</strong> Is a blog that i started as part of my learning path in Dev Bootcamp. In it you will find articles about web development and the insights that i  gain during this weeks of deep learning. i try not to go to deep into techinical descriptios about technologies, but more about their potential and holistic use. </p>
    <h3>Hello Git and Github</h3>
    <p>As my journey begins to understand the forces and powers that are underneath this beautiful invention called computers and their language, I get acquaintance with one of the tools that is not meant to directly help developers talk to computers but instead help them work together in teams.</p><a href="t1-git-blog.html">Read more</a>

    <h3>DBC Culture</h3>
    <p>Before talking about DBC, let me tell you a little something regarding my prior learning experiences both in college and school.</p><a href="c1-chefs-kitchen.html">Read more</a>

    <h3>Identity Crisis (Classes or IDs)</h3>

     <h3>Creating order in Ruby , Hashes and Arrays 101</h3>
    <p>Without order there’s just chaos, and we humans can and for most of the time live in chaos, but for a control freak like computer chaos is not an acceptable choice.  So we need to bring order in to their world so they don’t get a nervous wreck down.</p><a href="t4-arrays-hashes.html">Read more</a>

    <h3>Learning how to learn</h3>
    <p>So DBC it’s no really about coding, it’s true purpose is to teach how to learn and pick up new skills like your life depends on it. So one of the first things that I learn was that my learning style is “Concrete Random” , you may ask what the hell is a concrete random thinker , for your information I ask myself the same thing.</p><a href="c3_thinking_style.html">Read more</a>

    <h3>Enumerable to the Rescue:</h3>
    <p>So things are getting serious around here, no more fuzzing around with normal operators like + - /* , that’s child play, don’t even try to look cool just because you know how to use to_s , to_i or other as  you may thing fancy methods, don’t even try to say you are a programmer because you managed to write a while loop. Its time to play with the big boys and learn their weapons of mass destruction, its time to say hello to my little friend the Enumerable.</p><a href="t4-enumerable-methods.html">Read more</a>

    <h3>With great power comes<br>Great responsibility: </h3>
    <p>What a cheesy phrase to start with this blog post , what do I think I am a superhero? What will be my superhero name “The Keyboard puncher”? Don’t think so. What I do know is that knowledge is power and, very few people really know how to program and navigate their way through the tides of technology.  So following that logic all programmers have power and they should know how to use it. </p><a href="c4-tech-issues.html">Read more</a>

    <h3>Its all about Team Work and confidence: </h3>
    <p>Pairing it’s a big deal in DBC, so being comfortable with it it’s a most to have a successful experience with the program.  I strongly believe that working by pairs in a challenge it’s extremely beneficial when some criteria its meet, that means that in some cases bad experiences are going to arise. </p><a href="c5-feedback.html">Read more</a>

    <h3>Lets talk about Classes: </h3>
    <p>So by definition when we are coding we are trying to talk with the computer and explain to it how does our world works. So we need a way to describe as literal as we can the way things are order and classified in our real world to our dumber but quicker silicon friends.</p><a href="t5-ruby-classes.html">Read more</a>

    <h3>Do you even Psychology?</h3>
    <p>Hmm I’m Hispanic so i certainly most suffer from Stereotype threat, but not for the reasons that you may think.  In all honesty when I first start reading about Stereotype threat, my head keep thinking: no I’m not like that, no i definitely I don’t act like that, no I have never had my performance reduce by that.  But then as I finished reading I start considering the fact that o well shit I do suffer of Stereotype threat.</p><a href="c6-stereotype-threat.html">Read more</a>

    <h3>Let me Scope that variable for you</h3>
    <p>They all serve a different purposed and they all should be for different occasions. The big difference between them is Scope. Lets talk about each one independently:</p><a href="t7-oop-concepts.html">Read more</a>

    <h3>Immutable Values</h3>
    <p>I should start writing about the values that I feel most identified with, but it’s the first question the one that its still making me think, think of a time in your life where you’ve been the happiest, the proudest, or the most satisfied. That is hard question I really don’t have an honest answer to it, so many happy times, so many sad ones all mixed in a blur that I call memories, which in their on way are associated with emotions, but the question here is are they also associated with values?</p><a href="c7-values.html">Read more</a>

    <h3>Becoming multilingual</h3>
    <p> So this week I took my first steps learning how to write JavaScript. The first thing that I can say is that learning a second programing language is a lot easier than learning the first one. Thanks to the knowledge that I have now on ruby I was able to write JS programs with ease, this was an unexpected but well appreciated realization.</p><a href="t7-JavaScript.html">Read more</a>

    <h3>Conflict Resolution</h3>
    <p> I’m not a conflicting person, for most of my live I have managed to avoid creating or being involved in conflicts, and specially I’m a very hard person to get upset I think that live is to big to be concerned about small details.</p><a href="c8-conflict.html">Read more</a>

    <h3>How the internet works</h3>
    <p> The Internet is one of those things that everyone uses but almost no one knows how it works, it’s kind of like a magical box of wonders, funny cats pictures and double rainbows. But behind our everyday search marathons on the internet lies one of the most wonderful creation of the human being, and definitely one that has completely disrupt our way of living.</p><a href="t8-tech.html">Read more</a>
