    <p class="indent"><strong>Conversations with the Ghost in the Machine</strong> Is a blog that i started as part of my learning path in Dev Bootcamp. In it you will find articles about web development and the insights that i  gain during this weeks of deep learning. i try not to go to deep into techinical descriptios about technologies, but more about their potential and holistic use. </p>
    <h3>With great power comes<br>Great responsibility: </h3>
    With great power comes great responsibility:

    <p>What a cheesy phrase to start this blog post with, what do I think I am a superhero? What will be my superhero name “The Keyboard puncher”? Don’t think so. What I do know is that knowledge is power and, very few people really know how to program and navigate their way through the tides of technology.  So following that logic all programmers have power and they should know how to use it. </p>

    <p>Where I’m going with this you mas ask, well lets take a look at the most popular technology companies that exist today and that arise form the guts of Silicon Valley, witch ones are on the top of your mind? Let me take a guess: </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Facebook </li>
      <li>Twitter</li>
      <li>Twitter</li>
      <li>LinkedIn</li>
      <li>Snap chat</li>
      <li>Instagram</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Do you see a trend right there?  I think you do they are all social media companies and that’s something that worries me. The huge success of social media companies has foster new entrepreneurs to continue this trend and that makes me think, shouldn’t we be building things with this power that really helps us solve a tangible issue with our society? , Do we really need another way to share what I ate during lunch or post another picture of my egocentrically life? </p>

    <p>I really think that we should be building the stuff that’s in science books; the big corporations should be like the ones in Asimov stories (without going all Aperture science labs on us off course), its hard for me to think that the reference of a technology company is a glorified yearbook. Sure I’m going to get smack for saying that, how could I say negative things about our great social media that have bring us the way that the world functions today, well in my defense I was a happier person before any social media exist,  I don’t really see a benefit that they bring to my life (except cats gifs) , I don’t think that someone have a better life now that before thanks to them , but I do thing that we are now in a more stressful narcissist world, technology shouldn’t be about depersonalizing ourselves , it should be about enhancing us , letting us conquer those regions where our nature doesn’t fare well.</p>

    <p>I want new technology startups to be like Microsoft, Google, HP (in its old good days), and Apple. Nobody can live without the things that does companies have done, and they will be more memorable in the future than a Facebook that might be shinning right now but tomorrow could be next forgettable Myspace. </p>

    <p>But there’s hope, there’s a silver lining, that’s where companies like Palantir, Cloudera , Twilio and a lot small others that are working on really special technologies, I just wish that they where as visible as their social media peers and inspired others to be like they are.</p>
