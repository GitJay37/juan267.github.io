    <p class="indent"><strong>Conversations with the Ghost in the Machine</strong> Is a blog that i started as part of my learning path in Dev Bootcamp. In it you will find articles about web development and the insights that i  gain during this weeks of deep learning. i try not to go to deep into techinical descriptios about technologies, but more about their potential and holistic use. </p>
    <h3>Do you even Psychology?</h3>
    <p>Hmm I’m Hispanic so i certainly most suffer from Stereotype threat, but not for the reasons that you may think.  In all honesty when I first start reading about Stereotype threat, my head keep thinking: no I’m not like that, no i definitely I don’t act like that, no I have never had my performance reduce by that.  But then as I finished reading I start considering the fact that o well shit I do suffer of Stereotype threat. </p>

    <p>So what make my mind change its perception, as a bombshell I can tell you that it was a feedback from another student of DBC. Minutes before I start reading about Stereotype threat I had read the latest feedback that I had received, and one of them very accurately said that I was to complying with what others said and did not push my ideas as hard as I should.  This indeed was true but it was also flaw, I am complying when I feel that the person that I’m working with its more experience than me, but when I have the perception that my peer is equal or has lower knowledge than me this is not true.  And then it hit this is happening to me due to a Stereotype threat. </p>

    <p>Latin American people have a complete array of sterotypes to choose from, but none of the classic ones apply to how I see myself, that’s why when I first start reading I didn’t think that I would be a victim of Stereotype threat, but Latin American people also have a more obscure stereotype that is well know in the aviation business, which states that people from Latin countries are more willing to follow authorities figures, meaning that we will be less likely to question someone if we fell that they have a higher authority. This is know in the aviation business because some accidents have occur due to the copilot not questioning bad decisions from its higher authority peer the captain.   </p>

    <p>So once I mix both that review that I had and my new understanding about Stereotype threat I realized that I was I victim of it, I do tend to not question someone that I feel its more knowledgeable than me, and that can be holding me back and in general affecting negatively my learning. So from now on I will always ask before working with someone that I have the perception that is more knowledgeable than me, that they push me to be more questionable and that they force me to state my ideas and compare them with their ideas.</p>
