    <p class="indent"><strong>Conversations with the Ghost in the Machine</strong> Is a blog that i started as part of my learning path in Dev Bootcamp. In it you will find articles about web development and the insights that i  gain during this weeks of deep learning. i try not to go to deep into techinical descriptios about technologies, but more about their potential and holistic use. </p>
    <h3>Questioning on how to question:</h3>
    <p>Asking questions and being curious is one of the most useful personality traits that a person can have. Not taking things for granted and learning from other and our environment is what has fuel science and progress during the last centuries. So undoubtfully being able to ask good questions is a necessary skill to become a successful individual.</p>
    <p>A good question is one that is concrete; it delimits its problem to its most pure form.  Questions that are to general and that don’t have a clear and simple answer generally are not good questions, especially if we are talking about a literal and exact science like computer programing.  When you hear a good question the receiver most be able to immediately identify the pain point of the emitter, if the receiver of the question doesn’t comprehend in a very short span of time what exactly is the thing that is not being understood then the question was not good formulated.</p>

    <p>A good question is a short one, long obscure questions just create distractions; good questions are the ones that can be answer with few words and little discussion. I see myself as an individual that knows how to ask good questions, but this serves me as a double edge sword, because sometimes I inhibit myself of not asking a question that I disregard as dumb or unnecessary when in reality it would be better to not be so anal about asking questions.</p>

    <p>When I work in pairs or in a small team I feel empower to ask questions and in general to be inquisitive about what we are doing, but when I’m attending a lecture I tend to become more shy and that sometimes gets in the way when I try to make a questions, so I definitely have to work on improving that and not let my shyness or stubbornness get in the way of asking good questions that will help me and my peers absorb more knowledge. </p>
