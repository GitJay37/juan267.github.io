    <p class="indent"><strong>Conversations with the Ghost in the Machine</strong> Is a blog that i started as part of my learning path in Dev Bootcamp. In it you will find articles about web development and the insights that i  gain during this weeks of deep learning. i try not to go to deep into techinical descriptios about technologies, but more about their potential and holistic use. </p>
    <h3>How the internet works</h3>
    <p> The Internet is one of those things that everyone uses but almost no one knows how it works, it’s kind of like a magical box of wonders, funny cats pictures and double rainbows. But behind our everyday search marathons on the internet lies one of the most wonderful creation of the human being, and definitely one that has completely disrupt our way of living.</p>

    <p>So how does the inter works?. Well let’s start from the beginning. The Internet in its most basic form is a network. It connects computers around the world. When you connect to the Internet your computer gets assigned an IP address. That IP address represents the location of your computer and it lets you communicate with other computers by sending them packets to their unique IP address.</p>

    <p>When you want to send a file to a different computer, your computer chops that file in tiny pieces called packets, it also creates a set of instructions so that the computer receiving the packets can reassemble the original file and a check_sum that basically verifies that all the packages that where send di in fact arrived to their destination.</p>

    <p>Once you send a bunch of packets this travel using a router that are specializes computers that read the destination of the packets and send it to the next router that will keep moving the packet until it arrives to its destinations. During this journey the packets will go through the Internet backbone that it’s a set of fiber optic cables that transmit information at high speeds.</p>

    <p>When you start your browser and type a website url , what you are basically doing its asking an specific ip address to return some information to you.  So you send a message to the ip that in most cases is computer server sitting in a datacenter somewhere, once the message its receive by the server this respond back by sending several files that will be display on your browser and that untimely will composed the webpage that you are trying to look at.</p>

    <p>So as a quick glance the Internet is an interconnect network of computer and digital devices. All of these devices have unique numbers that represent them so that they can communicate between each other’s. To do this they send packets that get routed through the Internet backbone until the packets arrived to their destination.</p>
