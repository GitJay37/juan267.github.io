    <p class="indent"><strong>Conversations with the Ghost in the Machine</strong> Is a blog that i started as part of my learning path in Dev Bootcamp. In it you will find articles about web development and the insights that i  gain during this weeks of deep learning. i try not to go to deep into techinical descriptios about technologies, but more about their potential and holistic use. </p>
    <h3>Becoming multilingual</h3>
    <p> So this week I took my first steps learning how to write JavaScript. The first thing that I can say is that learning a second programing language is a lot easier than learning the first one. Thanks to the knowledge that I have now on ruby I was able to write JS programs with ease, this was an unexpected but well appreciated realization.</p>

    <p>The logic behind JS is the same one as in ruby , you have the same basic constructs and types like : Strings, Booleans, integers, floats, Arrays. You use the same tools like, loops, operators, variables and objects to create programs. What’s new is the syntax; JS syntax is a lot different from ruby syntax, in my personal opinion is way more complicated and difficult to learn. A simple example:</p>

    <p>To print something in the console in ruby you just do:</p>

    <p>Print “hello”</p>

    <p>The equivalent on JS is:</p>

    <p>Console.log(“Hello”)</p>

    <p>You have to type more letters, the meaning of console.log is a lot more cryptic, and you have to cumbersome parentheses in the way.  Besides syntax , JS also does some weird stuff that at first may seam to be good but then you realized that they can be a double edge sword, for instance JS can automatically convert expression types depending on the context, so a string can become an integer without you actually specifying it , this may be convenient but in some casas it can produce unwanted results, and JS is not as good as ruby in telling you what went wrong as it has far less types of errors and it allows a lot of faulty behaviors go unnoticed.</p>

    <p>   But in the end learning a second language was fun, and I think that once I’m able to manipulate websites with JS I will appreciate it a lot more.</p>
