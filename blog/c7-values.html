    <p class="indent"><strong>Conversations with the Ghost in the Machine</strong> Is a blog that i started as part of my learning path in Dev Bootcamp. In it you will find articles about web development and the insights that i  gain during this weeks of deep learning. i try not to go to deep into techinical descriptios about technologies, but more about their potential and holistic use. </p>
    <h3>Immutable Values</h3>
    <p>I should start writing about the values that I feel most identified with, but it’s the first question the one that is still making me think, think of a time in your life where you’ve been the happiest, the proudest, or the most satisfied. That is hard question I really don’t have an honest answer to it, so many happy times, so many sad ones all mixed in a blur that I call memories, which in their on way are associated with emotions, but the question here is are they also associated with values?</p>

    <p>In my 24 years of existence I have defined a value as something that is immutable, I don’t change them depending on the conditions, and I don’t have different values depending on my emotions.</p>

    <p>I can see that it may be easier to identify one values by exploring happy times, but for me the real test is when the shit is literally on the fan with a fly family circling it because the fan has stop working from corrosion and there is no wind to scare away the obnoxious bugs. Is those kind of times that really teach you what you are made off, how do you respond to circumstances and what really are your believes and values.  Those are the times when you really need to stick to your fundamentals and rely on them to help you navigate out of the shit and into a life of peacefulness. </p>

    <p>So sorry to hijack the instructions but I’m changing the initial question to be:  What are your values? Period. You should know them, they are your values, they kind of define how you behave, but ok if you don’t know them I will suggest thinking about the hardest time of your life and looking on how you behave during those times, that will really tell you the kind of person that you are.</p>

    <p>Enough rant for now, lets focus on the main topic, my values:</p>

    <p>Humility and loyalty are my core values. Humility is what makes me who I am, I’m a modest person I don’t like talking about myself, I don’t like exalting my achievements or taking defensive positions, my mantra has always been “ that I only know that I don’t know nothing” this lets me be open to other people points of views, it forces me to be curious and be in a constant search for knowledge and its align with the scientific method. I feel very related to science quest for knowledge and nothing is more humble that science way to approach problems in which you never know the truth, the only thing that you can know is that something its false. Loyalty it’s the force that shapes my relationships with other people, the number of friends that I have is small, and I don’t make new ones easily, it takes a lot of time for me to really feel comfortable with another person, but the upside off all of this is that when I say that someone is my friend it means a lot and that person can count with my loyalty until the end of times, that’s why I still maintain all of my friends from school and even if we don’t see each other in years we can say hello as we just saw each other yesterday. Loyalty is the value that defines the people that matter in my life and the way that I treat them.</p>

    <p>So Humility shapes the greater schemes of my life, it pushes me to new frontiers and gives meaning to my life. On the other hand Loyalty defines the way that I interact day to day and helps me maintain a healthy group of people around me.</p>

    <p>I do have other values, like respect, responsibility, honesty and others but they do not define me in the way that my core values do, they just help me be a better person on this rock and be able to fit in the society that we live in.</p>

    <p>Hope you like this little conversation with myself we left the machine on another room for today.</p>
